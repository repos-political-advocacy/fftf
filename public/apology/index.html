          <h1>Huge failure due to massive error.<br>We're sorry.</h1>
          <p>This is Tiffiniy Cheng, Holmes Wilson and Joshua Blount at Fight for the Future, a project of Center for Rights, which in turn is a 501(c)4 nonprofit with a 501(c)3 application in the works.  Tiffiniy and Holmes are the founders.  Joshua is our developer.  We're a new organization, but we're well-known for our efforts to stop SOPA & PIPA, the infamous website-blocking legislation.</p>
          <p>During the fight to stop SOPA, our ability to send emails to a large list was crucial.  We used our growing list of supporters to drive phone calls to the House and Senate at crucial moments and organized in-person meetings with Senators in 30 states.  Without that sustained activity, organized using email, the two spectacular protests would have seemed much less substantial to Congress.  If SOPA or similar legislation returns, email will let us notify the millions of people who took action, starting right where we left off.</p>
          <p>Back in January we decided to move to a new service (Action Kit) for sending emails.  During that process, we asked our former provider (Blue State Digital) for an export of subscribed users.  Instead, they gave us an export that included all users, and as a result, our last mailing went to every one of the 84,000 people who had unsubscribed from our list.  This makes us feel sick.  To everyone that happened to, we’re so sorry.  It will never happen again.</p>
          <p>The same mistake also destroyed our reputation with the anti-spam community.  In February, Spamhaus contacted us to say that harvested emails were getting on our list, and we worked with them to a resolution: unsubscribing all 33,000 emails from the petition that seemed to be the problem. After we dumped these emails, Spamhaus gave us the go ahead to continue using our list. We thought we were in the clear. But, the migration error not only made it so we emailed everyone who unsubscribed, but also put all 33,000 emails that we threw away back onto our list, which from Spamhaus’s view looked like us trashing our agreement.  Worse, coming from a new server at our new provider, it looked to Spamhaus and anyone else on the anti-spam frontlines that we were switching IPs to avoid their blocks (or even worse, that we’d been kicked off Blue State Digital).</p>
          <p>So to Spamhaus, the Mailsleaze blog, and everyone who works on fighting spam: we’re equally sorry, and we’re ready to do whatever it takes to rebuild your trust.  As a first step, we’re going to give you a detailed account so you can see what’s happened, and a list of things we’re doing right now to fix it.  Here are the areas we think are important (we’ve included dates, as well as key emails):
            <ul>
              <li><a href="#timeline-how-our-list-grew">Timeline: How our list grew.</a></li>
              <li><a href="#timeline-february-spamhaus-issue">Timeline: February Spamhaus Issue</a></li>

              <li><a href="#steps-were-considering">Steps we’re considering</a></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Finally, Fight for the Future is new on the mail delivery scene, but it’s founders aren’t.  We’ve built ethically-founded free software projects that people love (Miro, Amara, OpenCongress) we’ve worked for (Free Software Foundation) and alongside (Mozilla, the EFF) some of the internet’s most trusted organizations.   We have no conceivable interest in harvesting emails or emailing unsubscribed users.  Even if we did, we never would.  The anti-spam fight is about giving individual users control of the internet.  That’s what we’re fighting for too.  We’re committed to building something lasting, fighting for issues that many of you support.  I hope we’re worthy of your understanding, forgiveness, and most of all your help in finding fixes that let us continue our work.</p>
          <p>We still don’t know how harvested emails ended up on our list, but we know we need to take agressive steps to prevent it.  We’ve already had a hint of underhanded attacks: on Nov 22, 2012 our domain registrar Dreamhost pulled the plug on all our domains in response to an unverified complaint, days after the first SOPA protest.  If anyone with a botnet can shut down our ability to reach supporters by contaminating our list with trap addresses, we are screwed.</p>
          <p>If you can help, if you have any thoughts, or if you think there’s anything missing, please let us know: Thanks for reading this far--we hope the information below is even more helpful.</p>
          <p>Tiffiniy, Holmes, Joshua</p>

          <h2>Timeline: How our list grew</h2>
          <p>Our list grew at moments when sites with huge traffic (and many more small and mid-sized sites) were sending people to our pages with prominent links or embedded “write congress” forms.  All of our forms include a clear statement that we will contact people about future campaigns.  The vast majority also block multiple submissions from the same IP.  Until Spamhaus told us on Feb 10, that we were hitting their spamtrap addresses, we had no reason to doubt the integrity of our list.</p>

          <h2>Timeline: February Spamhaus Issue</h2>
          <p>On February 10 Spamhaus told our CRM provider that our list was dirty, that we were hitting Spamhaus traps.  They told us that the trap addresses we were hitting belonged to pages on listed on sopastrike.com.  They also told us (via BSD) that they had confirmed cases of failures to unsubscribe.  We didn’t know how trap addresses got on our list, but we agreed with BSD and Spamhaus on removing all emails from the sopastrike.com/ page as a first step.  Our understanding was that, if this didn’t work, we would remove a larger set of emails.  BSD fixed a bug in their unsubscribe page, and Spamhaus gave us the okay to send more emails.  By that point we were already in the process of migrating to Actionkit, so we didn’t send any more emails to the full list until April 6th.  (Two other emails in late March went to tiny parts of the list).</p>

          <h2>Timeline: Migration Disaster</h2>
          <p>In September 2011, after considering both Blue State Digital and Action Kit, we decided on BSD.  But in November we started to have serious issues and began discussing migration to Action Kit, making the final decision to move in January.  When we asked for an export of “subscribed users”, BSD gave us a table that included all users with no information on unsubscribes or bounces.</p>
          <p>This mean that our next mailing--months later--went to every user who had ever been on our list, breaking our promise to Spamhaus and any user who had asked to be unsubscribed.  In retrospect we should have verified that the data was what we asked for.  But there’s no conceivable misunderstanding; an export that included all users and no unsubscribe data was, essentially, a timebomb.  BSD has apologized to us, and can verify that the mistake was theirs.</p>

Feb 10, 2012 - 10:30am
We hear from Spamhaus for the first time that we are hitting their spamtraps, and agree on a solution with Spamhaus.

Feb 14, 2012 
With the solution implemented, we receive a greenlight to send more mailings, but we don’t send any more mailings until April 6.

Feb 28, 2012
As a resolution to the Feb 9 request entitled “Help backing up subscribed users?” BSD gives us an export we believe to include only mailable users.  Instead, it included all users, with no bounce or unsubscribe data.  We forward to Actionkit.

Mar 2012 
We put campaigns on hold while the migration is underway. Our setup on BSD required building self-hosted pages.  Because this was time intensive, we decided instead to focus on building a better setup with Actionkit rather than investing more time in improving our flow for creating static pages. 

Mar 3, 2012 
3/3 - Actionkit, seeing no bounce or unsubscribe data, asks us if the data we’ve given them includes mailable users only.  We say yes, because that’s what we asked for, and because BSD giving us a table with unsubscribed users is unthinkable.

Mar 13, 2012
Actionkit completes import of data.

DATE
We ask BSD for a list of any new subscribes and unsubscribes since the last export.  This does not include users from contaminated sopastrike.com lists that they already unsubscribed.   

DATE 
Actionkit imports the final unsubscribe data.  

DATE 
We send email to XX,XXX users in Iowa, because a Senator there is blocking a law-- driven by the startup community and introduced by one of the heroes from the house SOPA hearings--to simplify the immigration process for startup founders.

DATE
We send email to full list which (and we don’t know it!) includes every unsubscribed user, every bounce, and the 33.9k emails we agreed with Spamhaus to remove.  

DATE
Patrick at Actionkit reports a high number of bounces, but says it’s best to let the email run.  

DATE 
Patrick at Actionkit tells us we’ve been flagged by Spamhaus again, hitting “about 50” of Spamhaus’s trap addresses, an unthinkably high number.   

DATE
We discover that the data we imported from BSD included every user, including unsubscribes, bounces, and the 33.9k emails we agree with Spamhaus to remove.  From Spamhaus’s point of view, we trashed our agreement and switched providers.  They tell Actionkit they want us “turned off”.

DATE
BSD confirms that the export was their mistake, apologizes (full email text), and informs Spamhaus and Actionkit.  We start working on a document for Spamhaus, our users, and the broader anti-spam community on what happened (you’re reading it).

          <h2>Steps we're considering</h2>
          <p>Here’s what sucks: we know we’re on our last chance with Spamhaus and others, and we still don’t know the cause of the problem.  If we take the above steps and keep hitting spamtraps, we’re screwed.  If somebody gets a botnet and submits known harvested emails to our list, we’re screwed.  So before we start sending emails again, we need a better plan.  If you have expertise in this space and you have any ideas, please be in touch.</p>
          <p>Here’s what we’re considering for future signup forms to keep out fake submissions while keeping it easy to, say, contact Congress:
            <ul>
              <li>Use Facebook, Google, OpenID API for signups.</li>
              <li>CAPTCHA for anyone entering email</li>
              <li>Confirmed opt-in for anyone entering email</li>
              <li>Mutliple chances to confirm opt-in</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Here’s what we’re considering for existing users, to weed out any addresses that shouldn’t be there:
            <ul>
              <li>Go through our data looking for patterns consistent with single users or botnets</li>
              <li>Confirmed opt-in for all users who haven’t visited our pages from a link in an email</li>
              <li>Confirmed opt-in for all users who only signed up on one of our forms</li>
              <li>Confirmed opt-in, with multiple chances to confirm, for all existing users</li>
            </ul>
          </p>       
          <p>Confirmed opt-in for past users is tricky.  We promised everyone who’s on our list that we’d contact them if SOPA came back.  We don’t want to boot them from the list just because they neglect to open or read one of our emails carefully.  Nearly everyone we’ve talked to who does political organizing says confirmed opt-in is suicide.  We’re willing to break from that conventional wisdom, but we want data to back it up, and the ability to test different approaches.</p>
          <p>If you’ve taken the time to read this far, it probably means you care about us and the situation we’re in.  Thanks.  If you also have expertise or thoughts on how we can move forward, please be in touch. <a href="mailto:repairs@fightforthefuture.org">repairs@fightforthefuture.org</a></p>
