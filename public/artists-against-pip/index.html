        <h2>To members of the United States Congress</h2>
        <p>We, the undersigned artists, have all been empowered by the Internet. Today, artists can reach large audiences and make a living because the Internet and digital tools have democratized the means to create, distribute, and promote our work.</p>
        <p>We write to you today because we are concerned with S.968, the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA).  Copyright law exists to promote the arts, but the new penalties in PIPA could be used against the new social media channels we depend on to make a living, and endanger freedom of expression.</p>
        <p>PIPA creates new penalties against sites “dedicated to infringing activity,” but we worry it will be abused to attack legitimate sites we rely on. Many trailblazing social media websites could look like piracy havens to judges unfamiliar with the Internet.  In the past, music and film companies have attacked many new technologies - like the VCR and MP3 player - claiming that they were tools for piracy.  Recently, these same companies have sued video hosting platforms like Veoh and YouTube.</p>
        <p>Services like these let us reach a mass audience, one we could never access when television, film, and radio were the only ways to reach people.  PIPA gives traditional entertainment companies new paths to shut them down, and it creates new legal risks that will lead to future social media sites never being built.</p>
        <p>We use online video sites, file hosts like Dropbox and Mediafire, and online music communities like Soundcloud to host our work, collaborate with others, and build a community.  We fund our work with services like Kickstarter and Flattr.  We publish our work on sites like Tumblr, Wordpress, and Blogger.  Any one of these services could be sued under PIPA.</p>
        <p>Even more worrying is the potential for censorship.  Sometimes art is controversial.  We therefore value individual freedom of expression, and the extent to which the Internet's structure gives individuals this power.  We don't believe in undermining this freedom just to give more power to copyright holders, even if we may benefit from copyright ourselves.</p>
        <p>We recognize the music and film industry’s desire to control how their works get distributed. Sometimes we feel that way too.  But we worry that the proposed solution is far worse than the problem.  The better solution is for large entertainment companies to take advantage of the Internet’s ability to engage people, and use that engagement to sustain their work.  We are living proof that this is possible, and that creativity thrives online.</p>
        <p>Most of all, the work we do is inspired by the amazing things we see every day on the open Internet. We owe our success to that openness, and any threat to people’s basic ability to express themselves online is a threat to us all.</p>

        <h2>Congress needs to hear from Artists!</h2>

        <p>The PROTECT-IP act would censor the net, in the name of protecting "creativity" (read: copyright).  The law would let the government or corporations censor entire sites-- they just have to convince a judge that the site is "dedicated to copyright infringement."</p>
        <p>The law could definitely pass, but it's close.  If notable artists (musicians, actors, writers, media-makers, etc) speak out against the law, it will be a powerful statement, since the corporate music and film lobbies push these laws in your name.</p>

    <p>They have been expanding copyright's reach in order "protect creativity". This bill would cost us $10 billion tax dollars a year for a fix that won't work, disrupts the internet, stifles innovation, shuts out diverse voices, and censors the internet. This bill is bad for creativity and does not protect your rights.</p>
