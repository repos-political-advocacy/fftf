				<h1><span style="font-size: 2em;">W</span>hat people want from technology is usually pretty clear...</h1>
				<p>People love huge open libraries of music, books and video. They don't like censorship and legal landmines that get you sued for making amazing things. They love privacy and open platforms to create and invent. They're happy to pay for good stuff, but hate being coerced to pay for mediocrity and middlemen.</p>
				<p>And people are right to want all these things, even when governments and corporations, with their own narrow interests, try to paint this new, expansive cultural freedom as dangerous or destructive.  Our goal is to make the public's  interest vividly clear, so clear that not even the most powerful lobbyists and smartest monopolies can destroy it.</p>
				<p>We're living during a global shift as big as the industrial revolution.  Because of the internet, our future will work very differently than the world our parents and grandparents created.  We, as a society, are literally building a new world.  Fight for the Future is here to bring the most essential human values back into the debate about how society uses technology.  We believe there's hardly anything as important as ensuring that our shared future has freedom of expression and creativity at its core.</p>
				<p>To do it, we need your help. If you have ideas, tell us. If you care about this stuff too, follow us in whatever way’s best for you (email's best for us). We'll be gentle on your inboxes, and we'll try our best to only send things that are awesome.  When we do, share it. Hard.  Popularity and passion make good ideas dangerous to special interests.</p>
				<p>We're friends with EFF, Public Knowledge, FSF, Creative Commons, Demand Progress, Mozilla, Question Copyright and many more.  We care passionately about making real concrete change, and we are here to be successful.  Plus we're hiring.</p>
				<h2>To be a bit more concrete, we're asking:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>After spending thousands of years building libraries of donated books, why do governments try to tear them down when they happen spontaneously online? </li>
					<li>Why can't I give money directly to every musician I like, instead of paying Apple or Spotify and leaving virtually nothing in the pockets of the artists?</li>
					<li>Why does the US pay so much for cellphone service?  And for slow internet?</li>
					<li>How is it possible that singing "Happy Birthday" in public is still illegal, and why does anyone stand by these laws?</li>
					<li>Will every kid growing up in every developing country have access to every book ever made, as soon as they get a smartphone?  Or will the books cost $12, an impossible expense for a poor kid?</li>
					<li>Why have we all been sitting idly while the movie and music lobbyists have been systematically advancing legislation that strips freedoms, blocks innovation, and exclusively advances Hollywood's financial agenda?</li>
				</ul>
