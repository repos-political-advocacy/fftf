					<h1>Executive Director</h1>
				</div>
				<div style="padding-top: 20px;">

					
				<p>	Fight for the Future is a non-profit organization whose mission is to ensure that the web continues to hold freedom of expression and creativity at its core. We actively campaign and fight for the these ideals and are looking for an Executive Director who can be at the frontlines of helping to defend and protect the internet. The highlight of these efforts so far is the historic internet-wide strike against the web censorship bills SOPA and PIPA, and is an example of the impact a passionate few can have when engaging with the larger web community.</p>

					<p>Fight for the Future created the tools, message, and organizing principles behind the largest online protest in history and other popular campaigns; we rallied the public to defeat a bill (pushed by the RIAA and MPAA) that would let the US government (via the Copyright Office) block access to any website. And, we won -- see <a href="http://sopastrike.com">sopastrike.com</a> and <a href="http://americancensorship.org">americancensorship.org</a>, a campaign about proposed legislation that could put the next Justin Bieber in jail: <a href="http://freebieber.org">freebieber.org</a>, and a viral video at <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org/pipa">fightforthefuture.org/pipa</a>. This could be a dream job.</p>

					<p>We&#x27;re aiming to defend the internet against bad tech policy. Think the EFF, but focused on large public campaigns aimed at a mass audience (rather than strategic litigation).</p>

					<p>This is crucial work, and we&rsquo;ll be approaching it in the most fun and pioneering ways possible, with campaigns that make people laugh, change minds, and help people band together to exert their power. You will be on the front lines, building campaigns millions of people see and interact with.</p>

					<p>The Executive Director will be responsible for rallying a crowd and individuals around internet freedom issues, as well as leading and putting a face on our operations and fundraising.</p>
					
					
					
					<p>Our organization is focused on developing high-impact campaigns that resonate with people and help them band together to exert their power. This role is central to the organization and its effectiveness. If you ever wanted to build online experiences that reach out, grab people, and help them them change the world, then this is the job for you.</p>
					<p>We&rsquo;re looking for someone to continue to build that organization with us, from the ground up.</p>
					<p>You can be a veteran strategist, evangelist, or campaigner, a recent graduate with excellent writing and real activist experience, or anything in between.  To some extent we can build the position around your experience&mdash; the important thing is finding the right fit in terms of ability, style, and ambition.</p>
					<p><strong>Ideally, you should have experience with:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Running campaigns on high-impact issues</li>
						<li>Managing campaigns and responses to a fast-changing, dynamic field</li>
						<li>Working with a large variety of people, groups, and companies and spreading the message to as many stakeholders as possible</li>
						<li>Fighting against money in politics and heavily-funded lobbying teams</li>
						<li>Playing a key role in the planning and strategy of campaign organizing and organization growth</li>
						<li>Leading or starting coalitions</li>
						<li>Finding and securing new sources of revenue and funds (ideally)</li>
					</ul>
				
					<p><strong>You should also have experience:</strong></p>
					<ul>
					    <li>Running online campaigns that grow fast</li>
					    <li>Crafting exciting and persuasive actions</li>
					    <li>Using online and traditional media to achieve broad visibility (including by talking with press)</li>
					    <li>Fighting hard for something</li>
					</ul>

					<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who is gregarious and loves to talk to people. Your role would be to primarily reach out to groups and individuals and to relay the most important tech battles and issues to large and small numbers of people in ways that resonate with them. Therefore you should be able to think on your feet, and have smart, powerful ideas to share with others. You should understand and be able to express in ways that resonate with your audience the nuances and overarching themes of tech policy, free internet principles, and organizing on the ground and online.</p>
					<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone smart and savvy and who can be funny and playful with ideas; we&#x27;re looking for someone who can speak to people&#x27;s humor, fears and what gets them going; and we want someone who has purposeful humor and creativity as well as poignant ideas and language that can cut through political gridlock and debate.</p>
					<p>We look for people with a rigorous and thought-provoking perspective on a wide range of political issues, and especially on tech and policy. We want you to be a thinker and someone who can synthesize a problem or an idea out of ordinary interaction and frustrations / struggles.</p>
					<p>We&#x27;d especially enjoy someone who has a wide interest in pulling off tactics and strategy and using whatever resources are at their disposal -- you should have an interest in using law, policies, pop culture, music, philosophy, subcultural themes, memes, language, history, media, organizing playbooks, and whatever else is out there to pull off a really hard-hitting and exciting campaign for the right audience.</p>
					<p>If you&rsquo;re interested, send links to work you&rsquo;ve done to <a href="mailto:fftfjobs+campaigns@gmail.com">fftfjobs+campaigns@gmail.com</a>. Show us that you excel at the things we&rsquo;re looking for.  If you like, include links to or samples of your writing&ndash;ideally in situations where you&rsquo;re writing to persuade a group of people to believe something or take an action.</p>

				<p>	The team will be 100% remote-&mdash;no need to commute or relocate. If you&#x27;re interested in relocation, let us know. We&rsquo;d start working with you on a contract basis at an hourly rate, but we will be able to offer full-time position with competitive salary and benefits to the right person.</p>

					<p>Include as much relevant information as possible: significant things you&rsquo;ve done, projects you&rsquo;ve worked on, etc.  Being well-rounded is a plus, so don&rsquo;t exclude significant skills or achievements just because they aren&rsquo;t activism related (e.g. starting a business, or being a musician).</p>

					<p>Compensation: Market Rate / Commensurate with Experience</p>
					
					
					<hr />
					<p style="padding-top: 20px;"><strong style="display: inline;">Note:</strong> we expect this job announcement to reach a lot of people who are very politically active, but who may not be sold on the significance of this particular cause.  So here&rsquo;s a quick summary of how we see the threat and the opportunity:</p>
					<p>First, technology is increasingly the foundation for social participation and the pursuit of justice. We depend on a combination of software, devices, and the internet to get news, read books, organize others&mdash; a slew of essential activities.  Second, digital technology contains a basic social justice: once something gets made, it costs relatively little to give everyone access.</p>
					<p>This means two things: 1) to preserve our existing freedoms and institutions we have to fight to keep their technological underpinnings free from interference. 2) If we&rsquo;re successful we win much more than that: a world where everyone has equal access to many of humanity&rsquo;s most valuable creations (knowledge, cultural expression, and the digital tools to make more).</p>
					<p>There are several excellent organizations working on the same set of issues, but we think we can be much more effective by focusing on public-facing campaigns and employing a different mix of tactics.  The organization&rsquo;s founding team also has an interesting track record in doing just this.</p>
