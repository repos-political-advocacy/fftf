					<p>Fight for the Future is a brand-new activist org aiming to improve the laws shaping tech (e.g. copyright) by shifting the public opinion that shapes these laws.</p>
					<p>We're aligned with groups like <a href="http://eff.org">EFF</a> and <a href="http://publicknowledge.org">Public Knowledge</a> but we’re campaign-focused and public-facing. We recently launched a very successful campaign about proposed legislation that could put the next Justin Bieber in jail: <a href="http://freebieber.org/">freebieber.org</a></p>
					<p>This is your opportunity to help build the organization with us, from the ground up. </p> 
					<p>You can be a veteran email campaigner, a recent graduate with excellent writing and real activist experience, or anything in between.  To some extent we can build the position around your experience— the important thing is finding the right fit in terms of ability, style, and ambition.</p>
					<p><strong>Ideally, you should have experience, or want to gain experience:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Running online campaigns that grow fast</li>
						<li>Crafting exciting and persuasive actions</li>
						<li>Using online and traditional media to achieve broad visibility (including by talking with press)</li>
						<li>Fighting hard for something</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We're looking for someone smart and savvy and who can be funny and playful with ideas; we're looking for someone who can speak to people's humor, fears and what gets them going; and we want someone who has purposeful humor and creativity as well as poignant ideas and language that can cut through political gridlock and debate.</p>
					<p>We look for people with a rigorous and thought-provoking perspective on a wide range of political issues, and especially on tech and policy. We want you to be a thinker and someone who can synthesize a problem or an idea out of ordinary interaction and frustrations / struggles.
</p>
					<p>If you’re interested, send links to work you’ve done to fftfjobs+research@gmail.com. Show us that you excel at the things we’re looking for.  If you like, include links to or samples of your writing–ideally in situations where you’re writing to persuade a group of people to believe something or take an action.</p>
					<p>The team will be 100% remote-—no need to commute or relocate.  We’d start working with you on a contract basis at an hourly rate, but we will be able to offer full-time position with competitive salary and benefits to the right person.</p>
					<p>Include as much relevant information as possible: significant things you’ve done, projects you’ve worked on, etc.  Being well-rounded is a plus, so don’t exclude significant skills or achievements just because they aren’t activism related (e.g. starting a business, or being a musician).</p>
					<hr />
					<p style="padding-top: 20px;"><strong style="display: inline;">Note:</strong> we expect this job announcement to reach a lot of people who are very politically active, but who may not be sold on the significance of this particular cause.  So here’s a quick summary of how we see the threat and the opportunity:</p>
					<p>First, technology is increasingly the foundation for social participation and the pursuit of justice. We depend on a combination of software, devices, and the internet to get news, read books, organize others— a slew of essential activities.  Second, digital technology contains a basic social justice: once something gets made, it costs relatively little to give everyone access.</p>
					<p>This means two things: 1) to preserve our existing freedoms and institutions we have to fight to keep their technological underpinnings free from interference. 2) If we’re successful we win much more than that: a world where everyone has equal access to many of humanity’s most valuable creations (knowledge, cultural expression, and the digital tools to make more).</p>
					<p>There are several excellent organizations working on the same set of issues, but we think we can be much more effective by focusing on public-facing campaigns and employing a different mix of tactics.  The organization’s founding team also has an interesting track record in doing just this.</p>
